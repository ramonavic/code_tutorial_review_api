# Code Tutorial Review API

##INFO

A Restful API created with Rails that collects reviews of code tutorials. The API is made following the TDD principles. User needs to be authenticated. An example of the backend can be found [here] (https://tutorial-api.herokuapp.com/). The front end is created with React ([Github page]) (https://github.com/ramonavic/frontend_tutorial_reviews). 

##TODO: 

- User roles
- Calculate average ratings
- Delete function + specs

##SETUP

In order to use this we recommend to download both the front end and back end packages. 
After downloading the packages, type the following in your terminal: 

###Back end
```
bundle install
rails s -p 3001
```

###Front end
```
npm install
npm start
```

In order to use the backend locally, you'll need to change the Heroku URL to localhost:3001.
Then open your browser at localhost:3000.
